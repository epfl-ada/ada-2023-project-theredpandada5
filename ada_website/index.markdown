Movies are filled with clich√©s, recurring actions and persona archetypes, however these vary greatly amongst different genres. 
  From the CMU dataset we have information on the movies, some of their characters and the plot summaries. For this study, 
  we focus on romantic movies as many movies independent of genre contain at least one romantic subplot. Users can rate movies on 
  IMDB only since 1990, we therefore get a more modern perspective on the older movies. We want to analyze what makes specific 
  romantic movies more liked by larger audiences. To achieve this, the GPT-3.5 API is queried using binary questions to obtain 
  answers about plot elements and "Learning Latent Personas of Film Characters" is used to extract a persona type for characters 
  in specific movies. We can then analyze the ratings of romantic movies, as well as movies with some popular genres paired up 
  with romance, over time.
