    "content": "Who doesn’t love falling in love? Especially when you can do it over and over again, by following actors on screen? We all have seen romance movies, but the simple fact that two people fall in or out of love with each other does not equal a good quality story. And paradoxically, an unoriginal story can be exactly what we want to watch. Then what is it? Do we love them or hate them for being predictable?\n\nAnd what if we could find magical ingredients that make a good romance movie? How many clichés were necessary, which archetypes, what recurring actions? Wouldn’t you like to know? We do. So there it is, the story of romance movies, through their plots, persona and put it all together….\nWe begin by preprocessing the dataframe, augmenting it for project completion. The goal is creating a regression model to predict the success of romantic movies, followed by an analysis of their evolution over time and in the context of the other movie genres.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nROMANCE, ROMANCE?\nor the preprocessing story\n\nFrom the CMU dataset we have information on the movies themselves, some of their characters and the plot summaries. For this study, we focus on romantic movies as many movies independent of genre contain at least one romantic subplot. We can thus use movies containing romance in their genres. But is it enough?\nIt is then hard to analyze which movie really is about love, and which only contains a secondary love story.\n\nThe plot summaries might not contain all the necessary information about the plots to answer our most burning questions. Here is where the GPT-3.5 API comes to the rescue. Trained on more extensive summaries, it can answer questions about the plots in a more precise manner than an approximate word detection from the summaries. \nWe were then able to generate questions about plot elements (such as “Is there a best friend to lovers trope ?” or “Is there an empowered woman having regrets ?”) and obtain binary answers. Is GPT trustworthy? Mostly yes, but let’s examine a concrete example.\nIn the romance domain there are quite a lot of tropes that can be seen over and over again. From the many tropes that we wanted to analyze, we tried refining the questions such that in most cases GPT3.5 would be able to answer with yes or no. However sometimes the answers are highly dependent on the perspective and are not that black and white. When we did not agree with the answer, we asked GPT3.5 for a justification, and often the justification made sense. For instance, let’s take one of the most classic romance movies: The Notebook. In summary, it could contain lots of different tropes: enemies to lovers, a grand reunion, and a sad ending. But the enemies to lovers in this movie was one sided as the male protagonist Noah was immediately infatuated with the female protagonist. Therefore from his perspective it was love at first sight. \nSo answering yes or no to either question could be considered correct.\n\nLet’s also quickly mention Harry Potter. It indeed contains a romantic subplot, but that does not make it a romance movie. The same applies for other movies such as Spirit. So although these movies are great, removing them for our analysis is probably a better choice. We considered movies sufficiently romantic for our analysys when they contained more than 3 positive answers to the 20 questions asked.\n Let’s visualize the results of the proportion of answers, with 0 being a no answer and 1 a yes answer to the binary question.\n\n\n\nSo we have tropes. What about the personas? What if we could extract from the summaries the common archetypes for the characters in the movies? For example, is there a best friend that has an inexistent life beside providing advice on the romantic life of the protagonist, or the emotionally unavailable character that hides a soft heart underneath many layers of deception and no apparent feelings. Let’s get some help here. Extracting latent persona from the summaries, with the code from Bamman, O’Connor and Smith, “Learning Latent Personas of Film Characters” (ACL 2013), we therefore assign a persona type to characters.\n\nThe technique is called Latent Dirichlet Allocation, or LDA in short. This is a common unsupervised learning technique used over text data. In essence, its task is to extract the most important “topics” over a corpus. Topics can thus be represented as distributions over the vocabulary. The technique is again applied on the topics, yielding “personas”, ie. distributions over the topics ! The topics we obtained are shown in the table below.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Topic\n      Theme\n      Words\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      Mystery Drama\n      son, able, dead, detective, director, alive, former, agent, suspicious, about\n    \n    \n      1\n      Communication and Relationships\n      tell, love, see, ask, give, meet, confront, invite, call, talk\n    \n    \n      2\n      Supernatural Adventure\n      child, judge, fiancé, pirate, soul, human, spirit, teenager, waitress\n    \n    \n      3\n      Family Dynamics\n      mother, wife, son, baby, aunt, grandmother, president, single, pregnant, dead\n    \n    \n      4\n      Identity and Diversity\n      man, young, boss, old, soldier, other, guest, gay, angel, client\n    \n    \n      5\n      Action and Investigation\n      kill, tell, save, find, arrest, name, bring, force, warn, release\n    \n    \n      6\n      Emotional Relationships\n      tell, go, ask, say, love, want, give, get, come, walk\n    \n    \n      7\n      Life Choices and Actions\n      leave, take, see, be, find, run, have, know, make, look\n    \n    \n      8\n      Relationship Milestones\n      get, make, break, introduce, go, propose, end, spend, sleep, pick\n    \n    \n      9\n      Giving and Receiving\n      give, take, reveal, show, convince, offer, help, inform, keep, hire\n    \n    \n      10\n      Life’s Crossroads\n      die, give, want, come, refuse, leave, suffer, make, commit, welcome\n    \n    \n      11\n      Emotions and States\n      that, pregnant, one, angry, unable, happy, able, about\n    \n    \n      12\n      Family Members\n      husband, brother, kid, grandfather, younger, priest, twin, artist, older\n    \n    \n      13\n      Romantic Connections\n      marry, meet, fall, attract, send, name, engage, involve, reunite, find\n    \n    \n      14\n      Decisions and Actions\n      tell, have, try, arrive, offer, invite, send, arrange, believe, ask\n    \n    \n      15\n      Family Business Drama\n      father, parent, maya, phane, villa, own, late, dead, conservative, businessman\n    \n    \n      16\n      Struggle and Fight\n      capture, kill, send, take, rescue, lead, defeat, attack, return, free\n    \n    \n      17\n      Life Changes\n      have, live, visit, raise, name, care, leave, kill, move, reconcile\n    \n    \n      18\n      Artistic Pursuits\n      perform, play, sing, arrive, offer, conclude, quit, win, confide, dance\n    \n    \n      19\n      Social Roles\n      officer, uncle, owner, police, lady, bride, servant, new, vampire\n    \n    \n      20\n      School Life and Relationships\n      friend, student, best, boyfriend, old, school, teacher, girlfriend, character, high\n    \n    \n      21\n      Love and Relationships\n      marry, love, fall, leave, arrange, write, visit, propose, reject, inform\n    \n    \n      22\n      Discovery and Revelation\n      find, try, fall, manage, arrive, discover, attempt, refuse, die, learn\n    \n    \n      23\n      Diverse Female Characters\n      woman, daughter, young, beautiful, girl, lover, neighbor, cousin, wife, wealthy\n    \n    \n      24\n      Diverse Male Characters\n      boy, doctor, princess, worker, dad, villager, young, stranger, gay, Christian\n    \n    \n      25\n      Life’s Journeys\n      have, meet, decide, be, try, begin, want, find, realize, get\n    \n    \n      26\n      Criminal Activities\n      kill, shoot, confront, steal, beat, inform, drive, escape, attack, send\n    \n    \n      27\n      Royal Intrigue\n      king, de, son, captain, soldier, guard, master, prince, thug, dead\n    \n    \n      28\n      Historical Context\n      girl, sister, king, prostitute, little, musketeer, diner, older, native, younger\n    \n    \n      29\n      Life’s Movements\n      go, meet, return, come, live, arrive, join, stay, work, visit\n    \n  \n\n\nWe also make a distinction between agents, patients and modifiee : an agent is something the persona does, a patient is what is done to the persona, and a modifiee are adjectives associated with the persona.\n\nFor example, imagine we found the topics “Shoot”, “Cooking”,”Spy”, “Wedding”, “Escape”. We could say that a James Bond persona often escapes (agent), gets shot at (patient), and could be described as a spy (modifiee).\n\n[plot persona ??? tous en interactif ou un seul ?]\n\nWhat stands out? It appears that the most common characters are 12 and 8. The least common character is 9. Based on their key words, that seems likely.\n\n\n\nHOW MUCH DO YOU LOVE ME?\nor how to make a regression that (doesn’t) work\n\nLet’s get back to the basics. How do you evaluate whether a movie is liked? Ratings, obviously! Or box office revenue… Which is missing in 80% of the movies. As the correlation between the ratings and the box office revenue is weak, we will focus on the ratings as a success indicator. Bingo, that’s a measure of love… Isn’t it? For romance movies anyways. Take the CMU dataset, add a pinch of IMDB ratings, and you get a dataset with 11’599 movies having romance in their genre and their ratings.\nWe are aware that users can only rate movies on IMDB only since 1990, but that might just get us a more modern perspective on the movies that came out before the 1990s.\n\nOverall, what makes specific romantic movies more liked by larger audiences? To answer this difficult question, there are several angles that we can take since there are multiple layers in a movie. The script contains specific plot elements that we can unwrap partly using the GPT 3.5 API. The characters, or specifically the character types, can also give us hints about what happens in a movie. Lets take for instance the presence of a heartthrob bad boy. Does that make us like the movies more? The “Learning Latent Personas of Film Characters” might help us answer that. Of course we have no information about the visual aspects or the actors performance etc. Are there any specific questions that significantly correlate with the ratings? Turns out, there are! Have a closer look to the interrupted wedding, enemies  to lover, social status and serious illness tropes. The confidence interval of the ratings when GPT’s answer is yes or no is not overlapping. People do not seem to like interrupted weddings. Maybe it’s too dramatic? Instead they seem to like impossible love due to social status.\n\n\n\n\nEverything is ready now to begin unraveling possible secrets! What is the influence of tropes on the ratings? What about the persona present in the movies? And the two of them together? \n[plot or something showing it doesn’t work? Table ?]\n\nAND THAT’S A MATCH\nor how to reduce the impact of observed covariates\n\nWe have observed previously some correlation. However, movies have many confounders and a lot of variance. In order to get some real conclusion out of this study, the movies themselves also should find love, following the principle of “what belongs together comes together”.\nmatched study\n\nWHAT IF LOVE WAS ABOUT TIMING?\nor when to release a romance movie\n\nRegression doesn’t seem to work that well. Maybe it is because the audience changes over time, and so does their taste? Let us have a look at the evolution of the ratings over time. Is there a specific time of the year when people are more likely to watch a romance movie? A specific year in which some trope or persona is more popular? If we plot the average positive answers over time, we can observe that besides before the years 1920 – where there are not enough movies to have a significant average – the average positive answers are quite stable over time. Interrupted weddings, despite being significantly correlated with lower ratings, is still the most common throughout time over time.\n\n\n\n\nWhat about persona evolution? It seems like some persona are more stable over the years than others. There is an overall increase in all persona types over the years, which can be explained by the global increase in movie release. The persona 8 and 12 occurrences augment the most, which is consistent with their prevalence in the romance movies. Most persona actually don’t occur that much. It is hard to say whether characters were not assigned to a persona because the clustering was not giving a clear classification, or because the intersection between the datasets is small.\nThe sudden drop in all persona around the year 2010 could be due to the dataset goes only to the year 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nETHICS\n######\n\nHOW CAN WE MAKE THE PERFECT ROMANCE MOVIE?\nor turns out, it’s not that easy\n\nWe all know romance movies and their clichés. We like them to be what we expect. But maybe that’s not all. Maybe it isn’t enough to know the trope, the archetypes for the persona, the timing, the associated genres and even a combination of all of these.\nPredicting the ending of a movie is easier than predicting its success. Even if we explain at best []% of the variance of the ratings, we can’t explain it all. There may be no universal perfect love story. Everyone loves a different plot at a different time, and that’s actually not so surprising. \nPeople and their tastes are difficult to anticipate, and that doesn’t mean that what we’ve found is unfruitful!\n\nGlobally, we can still conclude a few things: TODO\n\n",
